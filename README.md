Here is application for team-profile generator.

Template is from instructor Scott Brunswig who gave our class permission to use this setup as submission for homework.

For this assignment you will need to install npm, to install it type in the following -- "npm init -y" -- which will give you a package.json file. After that you can install the dependencies required for your application to run. For this example it calls for inquirer & jest, so to install those I would type the following -- "npm i inquirer", then "npm i jest".

Once that's finished you can begin running the application which is titled the following --"node index.js".

This application will prompt you to answer queries that will then generate information about various members on a software engineering team which can be displayed as a HTML webpage which can be found in output folder titled team.html. There is also a test folder you can initiated by typing the command -- npm test --, it will run a test sequence of team-profile generator to catch any errors it may come across.
